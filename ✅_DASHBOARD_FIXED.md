# ✅ ANALYTICS DASHBOARD FIXED!

## 🔍 What Was the Problem?

The **Analytics Dashboard** wasn't displaying data from daily reports because the API endpoint `/api/reports/aggregate/[period]` wasn't properly handling the `period` parameter.

### **The Issue:**
- Dashboard was calling: `/api/reports/aggregate/30` (for last 30 days)
- API expected: `start_date` and `end_date` query parameters
- API was **rejecting** the request because it didn't understand the `period` parameter

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **1. API Endpoint Enhancement**
Updated `/api/reports/aggregate/[period].js` to:
- ✅ Accept `period` parameter (number of days)
- ✅ Automatically calculate `start_date` and `end_date` from period
- ✅ Return data in the correct format for charts
- ✅ Support both period-based and date-range queries

### **2. Response Structure**
Changed the API response to:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...array of daily reports...],
  "summary": {
    "period": "2025-09-22 - 2025-10-22",
    "total_expenses": 668.98,
    "total_general_revenue": 1863,
    "days_count": 2
  }
}
```

## 🚀 NOW WORKING!

### **✅ Verified Data Flow:**
1. ✅ Dashboard requests: `/api/reports/aggregate/30`
2. ✅ API calculates: last 30 days from today

5. ✅ Charts receive: properly formatted data

### **✅ Test Results:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8089/api/reports/aggregate/30"
