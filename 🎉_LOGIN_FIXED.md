# 🎉 LOGIN SYSTEM COMPLETELY FIXED!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **The Root Cause:**
The authentication system had a **database connection issue** where the Mongoose connection wasn't properly awaited before executing queries. This caused timeout errors.

### **The Solution:**
1. **Improved database connection handling** - Added `.asPromise()` to ensure the connection is fully established before use
2. **Added connection pooling** - Prevents multiple simultaneous connection attempts
3. **Fixed container hostname** - Changed from `bar-national-users-mongodb` to `users-mongodb`
4. **Rebuilt containers from scratch** - Cleared all cached data and volumes
5. **Re-created users with correct passwords**
